# ECMA31350-project
Final project for ECMA 31350 

## Research Topic

The effect of Natural resource abundance/GVC participation rates on political instability 

## Data

Dependent: political instability 

Independent: GVC participation rates by industry sector; mixed, forward, and backward
             Oil Reserves
GVC participation rates: from https://mrio.adbx.online/
   1. https://wits.worldbank.org/gvc/gvc-output-table.html


Controls: log of the share of mountainous land, Ethnic Fractionalization Index, Religion Fractionalization Index, Language Fractionalization Index, the log of population change, legal British origin, log of out-of-region disasters change, demeaned economic growth, and the change in the Democracy Index.
